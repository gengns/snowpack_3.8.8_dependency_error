# Snowpack issue

Dependency Load Error ENOENT: no such file or directory...

Can't use Apollo, Vaadin Web Components, etc; if Snowpack > 3.8.6

Minimal reproducible example in a temporary repository.

*Note that you will need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) installed.*

## Get started

Install the dependencies...

```bash
cd snowpack_3.8.8_dependency_error
npm install
```

...then start [Snowpack](https://www.snowpack.dev/):

```bash
npm run start
```
